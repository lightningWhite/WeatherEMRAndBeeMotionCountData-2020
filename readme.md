# Weather, EMR, and Bee Motion Count Data - 2020

This repository contains curated datasets for data collected during the months of May through October of 2020.
Weather and EMR data was collected by the [Weather and EMR Sensing](https://github.com/lightningWhite/WeatherAndEMFSensingStation) station.
Videos were collected by a [BeePi monitor](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/18/3743/htm) and processed using the Digital Particle Image Velocimitry algorithm as documented [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/5/2276).

Six beehives were monitored, and the data from each was individually paired with each of the two Weather and EMR Sensing station data sets.
